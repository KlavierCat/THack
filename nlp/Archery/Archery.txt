National Safety Council: Archery is three times more safe than golf. Seriously I do not understand this claim that insurance is the issue.
94% of archery injuries are caused by hunters cutting themselves with their razor sharp hunting arrows. These are not used by NASP children.
i go to organize my members "shut the fuck up umi i don't care about archery club"
Statistically ZERO. Archery is not dangerous.
Injuries to bystanders are statistically zero at archery ranges. (From the National Safety Council)
"As an indicator of how safe archery is, the insurance premiums are roughly the same as for badminton handball or golf."
